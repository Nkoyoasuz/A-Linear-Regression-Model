# A-Linear-Regression-Model
# üè° House Price Prediction in Nigeria using Linear Regression
     This project builds a Linear Regression model to predict property prices in Nigeria based on structured 
     property listing data. It covers end-to-end steps including preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, 
     evaluation, and visualization.

 #  Dataset
    The dataset contains listings of properties in Nigeria, with features like:
    * Price (Target variable)
    * Type (House, Flat, etc.)
    * Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Toilets
    * Parking Spaces
    * Total Area, Covered Area
    * District, State
    * Furnishing, Servicing
    * Service Charge
    * Other metadata

#  Setup Instructions
   * Clone the repository or download the code.
   * Install dependencies:
   * pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
    
# How to Run
  * Open the main Python script or Jupyter notebook.
  * Run the script step by step:
  * Load and clean the data
  * Encode categorical variables
  * Split into training and test sets
  * Train the Linear Regression model
  * Evaluate and visualize results
  * Output will include:
  * Model accuracy metrics (MSE, R¬≤)
  * A scatter plot of actual vs predicted prices
  * Top contributing features to price prediction

#  Model Performance
    Mean Squared Error (MSE): Shows the average error in price prediction.
  * R¬≤ Score: Represents how well the model explains the variance in property prices.

#  Key Features Used in the Model
   * Property type and location (encoded)
   * Number of rooms and bathrooms
   * Area size (covered and total)
   * Parking space availability
   * Furnishing and servicing details
   * Service charge amount

#  Future Improvements
   * Use advanced models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost)
